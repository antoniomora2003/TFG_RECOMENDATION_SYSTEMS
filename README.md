Description

This Final Degree Project (TFG) focuses on the recommendation of Points of Interest (POIs) such as restaurants or museums, addressing the challenge of data dispersion. Algorithms ranging from basic methods (Popularity, KNN) to advanced ones (BPRMF, GeoBPRMF, GNNs) are implemented, optimized using Bayesian techniques, and enhanced with data imputation.

Objectives

Implement and compare POI recommendation algorithms.
Mitigate data dispersion through imputation.
Evaluate the impact on metrics such as precision, recall, and F1.
Methodology

Data: Foursquare check-ins (Tokyo, New York, London).
Technologies: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, Torch-geometric, Skopt.
Process: Data preprocessing, Bayesian optimization, evaluation with and without imputation.
Results

Algorithms are analyzed using performance metrics (precision, recall, F1), highlighting the effect of imputation on recommendation quality.

Conclusions and Future Work

Imputation improves model performance. It is proposed to explore generative neural networks (GANs) for future advancements.
